# Seriea_Data_Analysis
Different Co-relations drawn from data analysis of stats from the Italian top flight football.  
This Project is aimed at doing efficient and effective data analysis of the serie a 17/18 season .
I'll also expand it to 18/19 season when I train the 17/18 datasets. GraphicalAnalysis file will have different
functions for showing the correlation b/w shots, cards, goals etc. The Code is in python 3.6 and needs Anaconda library to
run and work.
